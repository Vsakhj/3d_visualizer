# 3D Data Visualization: Cube Vertices Scatter Plot

## Project Overview
This project is a work sample demonstrating foundational skills in **3D data generation and visualization** using Python, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib`. It creates a simple 3D scatter plot of the 8 vertices of a cube, providing a visual representation of how to handle and display data in a three-dimensional space.

This project showcases my abilities in:
* **Python Programming:** Writing and structuring Python code.
* **Numerical Computing (`NumPy`):** Generating and manipulating arrays of numerical data, which is fundamental for machine learning.
* **3D Coordinate Understanding:** Working with and defining points in 3D space.
* **3D Data Visualization (`Matplotlib`):** Creating clear and informative visual representations of multi-dimensional data, a crucial skill for analyzing datasets in machine learning, understanding feature spaces, or interpreting model outputs.

While this is a foundational example, it highlights my capacity to work with spatial data, a skill highly relevant to the Machine Learning Work From Home Internship, especially in areas involving geometric understanding or spatial analysis.

## How to Run This Project
1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/YourRepositoryName.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/YourRepositoryName.git)
    cd YourRepositoryName
    ```
2.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib numpy
    ```
3.  **Execute the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python 3d_visualizer.py
    ```
    This will:
    * Generate the 3D cube vertices.
    * Open an interactive window displaying the 3D scatter plot.
    * Save the `3d_scatter_cube.png` image in the `3d_visualizations/` directory.

## Output Example
*(It is highly recommended to upload a screenshot of your generated `3d_scatter_cube.png` here. You can drag and drop it into the README editor or link it from a service like Imgur. This provides a quick visual for recruiters.)*

**Note to recruiter:** As a self-learner actively building my portfolio, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply and expand these foundational skills to real-world challenges in a dynamic environment.
